<h2><a href="https://www.democracydevelopers.org.au/"><img style="height:4em;" src="https://www.democracydevelopers.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kangaroo-badge-1.png"/></a> Show the effect of assertions</h2>
<p>This graphically shows the implications of a set
    of assertions about an IRV (instant runoff) election
    which hopefully combine to conclude that there is only one
    possible winning candidate.</p>
<p>This is useful if you have been convinced (from auditing) that
   each of the individual assertions is true, and now want to
   see what that implies about the whole election. This page
   demonstrates the logic in a manner that is reasonable for a human
   (rather than a computer) to check.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input is a JSON file describing the assertions.  Or load from file <input type="file" id="InputFile"></p> 
    
<p>Current formats accepted are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The output of <a href="https://github.com/michelleblom/audit-irv-cp/tree/raire-branch">RAIRE</a>, primarily by Michelle Blom (example : <span id="MichelleExamples"> </span>) </li>
    <li>The output of <a href="https://github.com/DemocracyDevelopers/raire-rs">raire-rs</a>, a rewrite of the above primarily by Andrew Conway (examples : <span id="EgGuideToRaire"> </span>)</li>
    <li>The log from <a href="https://github.com/pbstark/SHANGRLA">SHANGRLA</a>, primarily by Phillip Stark. (example : <span id="SHANGRLAExamples"> </span>)  </li>
